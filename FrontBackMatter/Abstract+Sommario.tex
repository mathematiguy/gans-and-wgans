\chapter*{Abstract}
This group project explores the theory behind Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which apply useful concepts from Optimal Transport (OT) to the task of image generation. We compare Wasserstein GANs with their predecessor, the GAN and also compare the approach with the more recent phenomenon of diffusion based image generation algorithms.

% This package changes some typographical features of the \classicthesis{} style, by Andr√© Miede. It allows to reproduce the layout of the guide \emph{The Art of Writing with \LaTeX} (in Italian)~\citep{pantieri:art}.  The hint for this original reworking of \classicthesis{} was given to me by Daniel Gottschlag. This package was written for the Italian \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} User Group (\url{http://www.guitex.org/}).
